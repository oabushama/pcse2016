## I have committed changes and try to push them to the repository
##
[03 MPI:80] hg push pcse2016
pushing to https://VictorEijkhout:***@bitbucket.org/VictorEijkhout/pcse2016
searching for changes
remote has heads on branch 'default' that are not known locally: 70f6f2e903f2
abort: push creates new remote head 0c029a7fddc2!
(pull and merge or see "hg help push" for details about pushing new heads)
##
## Strange error!
## but note the "pull and merge" hint on the last line...
## Apparently the remote repository has changes that I need to pull
##
[03 MPI:81] hg pull -u

adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
added 3 changesets with 3 changes to 3 files (+1 heads)
not updating: not a linear update
(merge or update --check to force update)
##
## Again note that last line: it tells me to merge
##
[03 MPI:82] hg merge
2 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
(branch merge, don't forget to commit)
##
## Now it tells me don't forget to commit
##
[03 MPI:83] hg commit -m "merging"
## 
## ....and now finally I can push my changes
##
[03 MPI:84] hg push pcse2016
